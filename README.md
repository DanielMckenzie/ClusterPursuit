# ClusterPursuit
 - Code for Cluster Pursuit algorithm, as detailed in "Compressive Sensing for cut improvement and local clustering." by Ming-Jun Lai and Daniel Mckenzie
 - Paper available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05780.pdf and to appear in SIAM SIMODS.
 - For Benchmarking, you will need the matlab_bgl toolbox, available at: https://github.com/dgleich/matlab-bgl, the simple-local toolbox, available at: https://github.com/nveldt/SimpleLocal and David Gleich's implementation of the flow_improve algorithm, available here: https://dgleich.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/fast-partition-improvement-with-flowimprove/
 - For the MNIST experiments, you can either use the raw MNIST files available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ or email me and I will figure out a way to send the MAT files to you (they are quite large).
